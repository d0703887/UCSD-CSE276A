## CSE 276A PA3
Set up a environment in a 10ft x 10ft area with landmarks (LM) as the figure exemplifies and implement the KALMAN filter-based SLAM system. Start from a pose inside the square (robot does not know the start pose) and drive through the environment to build up a map.
```
          LM          LM
        ______      ______

   |                          |       
LM |                          | LM
   |                          |

   |                          |       
LM |                          | LM
   |                          |
   
        ______      ______
          LM          LM
```

Drive through the environment in a square path and in an 8-point octagon trajectory.
