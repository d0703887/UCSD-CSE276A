# UCSD CSE 276A Introduction to Robotics
This repository contains the Programming Assignments (PAs) for CSE 276A at UCSD. The assignments follow a series of milestones culmulating in the design of a "Roomba" like robotic system. The goal is to develop a robot capable of covering a significant percentage of an unknown area using real-time planning.
