## CSE 276A PA5
Design a "roomba" like system. The robot should be able to navigate an environment and provide a level of coverage of the area.
1. Set up an environment in a 10ft x 10ft area with landmarks at the edges as shown in the figure.

LM |                                  | LM
   |                                  |

   |                                  |       
LM |                                  | LM
   |                                  |
        ______    ______    ______    
          LM        LM        LM
